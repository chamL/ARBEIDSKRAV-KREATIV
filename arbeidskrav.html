        Muhammad Ali's dream of boxing greatness carried him through a series of iconic showdowns.
         These top fights were pivotal moments where Ali's dream met reality.
        In the "Fight of the Century" against Joe Frazier in 1971,
         Ali faced his first pro defeat but emerged stronger, 
         reaffirming his dream. The historic "Thrilla in Manila"
          rematch showcased his unwavering spirit and a dream that refused to be extinguished.
        Ali's dream extended beyond the ring, exemplified by his "Rumble in the Jungle"
         with George Foreman. This fight was more than just a victory it was a manifestation of his dream's power.
        Through legendary bouts against Ken Norton and Leon Spinks, 
        Ali's dream remained undiminished. Join us as we revisit these moments,
         honoring the dream that defined the legacy of the greatest boxer of all time.</p>
